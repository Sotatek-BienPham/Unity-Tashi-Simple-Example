## Add Network Manager and Funtional button : 
- Create empty GameObject, add Network Manager component : Choose Transport protocol, drag player prefab and setup network prefabs lists.
- Choose Tashi Network Transport : Fill setup for relay base url or not. 
- Create in UI some buttons such as Start Server, Start Host and Start Client. Each button will call the function corresponding to function in Network Manager. 
- Create empty GameObject and attach new script to manage this scene. Script maybe have name like PlaySceneManager.cs 
- Open PlaySceneManager.cs and add some basically func : Start Host, Start Server, Start Client. using Unity.NetCode to use NetworkManager.Singleton or get info about NetCode.
- Add onClick for 3 button that we created before
- In Player Prefabs : Add component Network Object, Network Transform, Network Animation .. for sync some basic info. 
- Here I override Network Transform and Animation to Client Network Transform, Client Network Animation to turn off authoriatative from server. Trust on your clients.
